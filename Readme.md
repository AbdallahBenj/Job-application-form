# Job Application Form - Certification Project

## Overview
This project is part of the certification requirements. In this lab, I created a **Job Application Form** using HTML and styled it with CSS. The focus of the project is on using **CSS pseudo-classes** like `:hover`, `:active`, and `:focus` to enhance user interaction and accessibility.
